<h1>New species identified from decades old museum recording</h1>
<p>We discovered a sound record of a species of the Acrometopini group taken on 16th March 1972 by the entomologist David Hollis in Angola as part of the South Western Africa Expedition. The sound recording, deposited in the British Museum (Natural History) Library of Recorded Insect Sounds, was later made openly accessible in the BioAcoustica repository. The species was identified as previously unknown to science and described as <i>Horatosphaga raggei</i> Heller & Baker, 2017, named after David Ragge for his work on African Acrometopini and for establishing bioacoustic research at the Natural History Museum.</p>
