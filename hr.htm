<h1>New species identified from decades old museum recording</h1>
<p>We discovered a sound record of a species of the Acrometopini group taken on 16th March 1972 by the entomologist David Hollis in Angola as part of the South Western Africa Expedition. The sound recording was deposited in the British Museum (Natural History) Library of Recorded Insect Sounds, and was later made openly accessible in the BioAcoustica repository. The species was identified as a species previously unknown to science and described as <i>Horatosphaga raggei</i> Heller & Baker, 2017.</p>
