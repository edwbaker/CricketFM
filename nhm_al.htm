<h1>The old acoustic laboratory at the Natural History Museum, London</h1>
<p>David Ragge was already interested in Orthoptera songs when he joined the staff of the Natural History Museum, London in 1952. It was only in the early seventies that a proper acoustic laboratory could be built, with the necessary equipment for fully exploiting these sounds for identification and taxonomic research.  The laboratory was completed in 1973 (on the top of the Spirit Building, now demolished) and Jim Reynolds was appointed to help me use it.  The laboratory remained in use until 1998, after which it was converted to a completely different use.</p>
